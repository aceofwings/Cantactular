Note from Author

Its been a very awesome learning experience developing the engine. I see the engine ands its code
as a framework to build other applications. The "engine" application simply does a lot of translating between readable messages
and raw can_frames. The components itself, such as the engine module have been designed to be easiliy modifed to recieve and delegate
messages to listeners, rather then being server. I see plenty of improvement in the future, such as controllers not having direct acess to an engine,
and have certain resources such notifiers. I do want to add a concrete loggging module too.

Anyway this will be my last commit as I am too busy with current devlopment and other projects.
